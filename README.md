- 👋 Hi, I’m @sethj78737
- 👀 I’m interested in pretty much all things digital media; photography, video production, motion design, animation, visual effects, and now coding for design workflow.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript and extendscript for after effects.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on workflow projects, extendscript training, and pretty much anything having to do with after effects.
- 📫 How to reach me, email is best.
